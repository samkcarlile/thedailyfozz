##How to contribute
Contributing is really easy. Just head over to [images.json](https://github.com/samkcarlile/thedailyfozz/blob/gh-pages/images.json) and add your date and image link
to the JSON.

####If you are not familiar with JSON, here is a step-by-step

- 1. Locate the bottom of the file. It will be the only line that doesn't end with a comma (besides the brackets that remain at the top and bottom of the file) and looks like this:
```
"03/31/16": "http://imgur.com/asdf",
"04/01/16": "http://imgur.com/asdf" //<--- This is the end of the JSON
}
```
- 2. Add a comma to the last line, like this:
```
"03/31/16": "http://imgur.com/asdf",
"04/01/16": "http://imgur.com/asdf", //<--- See how I added a comma here.
}
```
- 3. Add a new line and type your date in qoutes. Make sure to format it correctly.
```
"03/31/16": "http://imgur.com/asdf",
"04/01/16": "http://imgur.com/asdf",
"04/02/16" //<-- I added a new line and typed my date.
}
```
- 4. Add a colon, space, and then paste your imgur link in qoutes.
```
"03/31/16": "http://imgur.com/asdf",
"04/01/16": "http://imgur.com/asdf",
"04/02/16": "myImgurLinkInQoutes.com"
}
```
- 5. Done! Visit [thedailyfozz.pw](http://thedailyfozz.pw) and look at your new fozz! (If it's the same day you added of course.)
